# Float IEEE-754 Converter
Small program to get binary representation of a 32 bits float in IEEE-754 format. IEEE is a broadly used for Floating-Point Arithmetic in computers. I made this small program for funsies. 

# Example building and execution on linux:
```
git clone repo
cd Float-IEEE754/src

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
