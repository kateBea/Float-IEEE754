# Float IEEE-754 Converter
Small program made for funsies that gets the binary representation of a single precision float in IEEE-754 format, which is a broadly used standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic in computers. For just getting the underlying binary representation of a float one can use unions for example.

# Example building and execution:
```
git clone repo
cd Float-IEEE754/src

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
